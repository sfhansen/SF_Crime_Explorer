# Introduction

This application creates an interactive visualization tool to explore San Fransisco crime data from 2015. 
The application is composed of two scripts: ui.r, which initializes the user interface and server.r, which updates 
data queries. Data were acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime and cleaned to represent crimes in 2015 only.
